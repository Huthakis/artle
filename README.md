# artle
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
A wordle type clone for art and art prices. On each refresh, the user is presented with a piece of artwork and given up to 6 rounds to correctly guess its price (to within 10%). After each guess, the user will be told if their guess was too high, or too low, and presented with a bit of information about the painting or artist.

This project was inspired a YouTube video from Wendover Productions called "The Art Market is a Scam (And Rich People Run It). The video covers how some art fetches massive auction prices, then discusses how these prices are manipulated by purchasers and dealers.
